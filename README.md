EDX Sass Comments Sublime Text package
===============================================

Sass style comments for Sublime Text. This repo was forked from [Idiomatic CSS Style Comments](https://github.com/erskinedesign/Idiomatic-CSS-Comments-Snippets) with adjustments made by the Erskine team so that comments can be stripped from markup without the use of another workflow.

Comment format based on Idiomatic CSS by Nicolas Gallagher (https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
